# LLM Providers

Use this page to choose which models power [the Sim Agent](./sim-agent.md) and
other Sim-owned AI features, including [Inline Assistant](./inline-assistant.md),
Git commit generation, thread summaries, and similar model-backed features.

Model access paths do not configure [External Agents](./external-agents.md) or
[Terminal Threads](./terminal-threads.md). External Agents and Terminal Threads
usually own their own model access, auth, and configuration.

Use the setup pages for provider-specific details. See [Agents](./agents.md) for
the difference between the Sim Agent, External Agents, and Terminal Threads.

## Edit Prediction {#edit-prediction}

[Edit Prediction](./edit-prediction.md) has its own provider setup under `edit_predictions`. LLM providers on this page apply to model-backed Sim AI features such as Sim Agent, Inline Assistant, Git commit generation, and thread summaries.

## OpenAI-Compatible Providers {#openai-api-compatible}

OpenAI-compatible provider setup has moved to [Use API Access](./use-api-access.md#openai-compatible).
