# Feedback and Training Data

Normal AI requests are not retained by Sim. For
[Sim-hosted models](../account/sim-hosted-models.md), provider agreements
prohibit training on your prompts or code context and require zero data
retention, except for
[provider-designated models with safety retention](./privacy-and-security.md#provider-safety-retention),
such as Anthropic's Mythos-class models.
This page covers the cases where Sim may retain AI data because you explicitly
shared it or opted in.

AI features in Sim include:

- [Agent Panel](./agent-panel.md)
- [Edit Prediction](./edit-prediction.md)
- [Inline Assistant](./inline-assistant.md)
- [Git commit generation](../git.md#ai-support-in-git)

For the broader request path and provider data boundaries, see
[AI Privacy](./privacy-and-security.md).

## Sim-Hosted Model Commitments {#data-retention-and-training}

Sim-hosted model zero-data-retention and no-training commitments, including the
exception for provider-designated models with safety retention (such as
Anthropic's Mythos-class models), are documented
on [AI Privacy](./privacy-and-security.md#data-retention-and-training).

## Response Ratings and Feedback {#ai-feedback-with-ratings}

You can rate AI responses or submit feedback to help improve Sim's system prompt,
tools, and AI product experience. Each share is opt-in, and sharing once does not
grant permission for future collection.

> **Warning:** Rating an AI response sends the conversation thread to Sim. The
> conversation thread includes your messages, AI responses, and thread metadata.
> If you do not want the thread persisted by Sim, do not rate the response.

### Data Collected from Feedback {#data-collected-ai-feedback}

For conversation threads you explicitly share through ratings or feedback, Sim
may store:

- your messages and AI responses in the conversation thread
- any commentary you include with your rating or feedback
- thread metadata, such as model used, token counts, and timestamps
- metadata about your Sim installation

If you do not rate responses or submit feedback, Sim does not store Customer Data
related to your AI feature usage for improvement.

Telemetry related to Sim's AI features is collected separately. This includes
metadata such as the AI feature being used and high-level interactions with the
feature to understand performance, such as agent response time or edit acceptance
and rejection. See [Telemetry](../telemetry.md) for details.

Collected feedback data is stored in Snowflake. Sim periodically reviews this
data to refine prompts, tools, and product behavior. Stored feedback data is
anonymisim and stripped of sensitive information such as access tokens, user IDs,
and email addresses.

## Edit Prediction Training Data {#edit-predictions}

Sim does not collect training data for the Edit Prediction model unless all of
these conditions are met:

1. You opt in by toggling **Training Data Collection** under the **Privacy**
   section of the Edit Prediction status bar menu.
2. The project is open source, detected by the presence of a license file. See
   the [license detection logic](https://github.com/simtropolis/sim/blob/main/crates/edit_prediction/src/license_detection.rs).
3. The file is not excluded by `edit_predictions.disabled_globs`.

Edit Prediction setup and provider configuration live on the
[Edit Prediction](./edit-prediction.md) page. This page only covers training data
collection and retention.

### File Exclusions {#file-exclusions}

Certain files are always excluded from Edit Prediction training data collection,
regardless of opt-in status:

```json [settings]
{
  "edit_predictions": {
    "disabled_globs": [
      "**/.env*",
      "**/*.pem",
      "**/*.key",
      "**/*.cert",
      "**/*.crt",
      "**/.dev.vars",
      "**/secrets.yml"
    ]
  }
}
```

You can explicitly exclude additional paths or file extensions by adding them to
[`edit_predictions.disabled_globs`](https://sim.dev/docs/reference/all-settings#edit-predictions)
in your Sim settings file ([how to edit](../configuring-sim.md#settings-files)):

```json [settings]
{
  "edit_predictions": {
    "disabled_globs": ["secret_dir/*", "**/*.log"]
  }
}
```

### Data Collected from Edit Prediction Training {#data-collected-edit-prediction-training}

For open source projects where you opted in, Sim may collect:

- code excerpts around your cursor
- recent edit diffs
- the generated prediction
- repository URL and git revision
- buffer outline and diagnostics

Collected data is stored in Snowflake. Sim periodically reviews this data to
select training samples for inclusion in the model training dataset. Included
data is anonymisim and stripped of sensitive information such as access tokens,
user IDs, and email addresses.

The training dataset is publicly available at
[huggingface.co/datasets/simtropolis/zeta](https://huggingface.co/datasets/simtropolis/zeta).

### Training Dataset and Model Output {#training-dataset-and-model-output}

Sim uses this training dataset to fine-tune
[Qwen2.5-Coder-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B) and makes the
resulting model available at
[huggingface.co/simtropolis/zeta](https://huggingface.co/simtropolis/zeta).

## Business Controls {#business-controls}

On Sim Business, data sharing is off by default and controlled by organization
administrators. Administrators can prevent members from submitting agent thread
feedback or opting into Edit Prediction training data collection. See
[Privacy for Business](../business/privacy.md) and
[Admin Controls](../business/admin-controls.md#data-sharing).

## Applicable Terms {#applicable-terms}

See the [Sim Terms of Service](https://sim.dev/terms) for more.
