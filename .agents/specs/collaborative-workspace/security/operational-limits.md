# Collaborative Workspace operational limits

## Purpose and policy

This registry makes acceptance criteria 8.4, 19.3 and 19.5 measurable for CAP-004, CAP-006, CAP-028 and CAP-043. It consolidates the limits required by the Collaborative Workspace threat models and accepted ADRs without changing their ownership or migration strategy.

Every row below is normative for the first production-capable Zed deployment unless its value is explicitly described as a compatibility ceiling. A lower deployment limit is allowed when advertised through the appropriate protocol/configuration and validated at startup. Raising a hard security or compatibility ceiling requires security review, conformance evidence and a versioned configuration change; an environment variable alone cannot bypass it.

Metric names are target Zed names for Tasks 44.5 and 45.4–45.5. All metric labels are closed enums plus bounded deployment/region/service identifiers. Community IDs, user/agent keys, channel/job/event/request IDs, repository paths, URLs, model prompts/output, message/media content, endpoint tokens and secrets are prohibited as labels. Per-community diagnosis uses access-controlled logs/traces with pseudonymous correlation handles and retention, never public Prometheus labels.

Alerts use the following conventions:

- **Page** means user traffic is unsafe, silently divergent or broadly unavailable and requires immediate operator action.
- **Warn** means a bounded failure budget is being consumed and requires investigation during the support window.
- A ratio is evaluated only with at least 100 relevant operations in the stated window unless the row says any occurrence.
- Hard-limit rejection is an expected safe outcome; the alert detects abuse, bad clients, misconfiguration or insufficient capacity rather than asking operators to weaken the limit.

## Limit registry

### Connections, protocol and synchronization

| Limit ID | Enforced limit and failure behavior | Canonical owner | Metric and alert threshold | Focused verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OL-CON-01 | At most 10,000 live collaboration WebSockets per replica; additional upgrades return typed capacity unavailable before allocating connection state. | `collab::transport` connection semaphore | `collab_connections_active`; warn at ≥8,000 for 10m, page at ≥9,500 for 5m or capacity rejects >1% for 5m | Tasks 22.1, 44.3, 45.4 |

| OL-CON-09 | Relay graceful drain is 30s inside a 60s pod grace period; reconnect jitter is configurable from 0–20s and any undrained connection is closed visibly at the deadline. | `collab` service lifecycle and deployment | `collab_drain_active`, `collab_drain_forced_closes_total`; warn any forced close, page drain exceeds 30s or pod grace is <60s | Tasks 22.1, 44.3, 45.4 |

### Durable queues, projections, search and read state

| Limit ID | Enforced limit and failure behavior | Canonical owner | Metric and alert threshold | Focused verification |

## Required dashboards and stop signals

Task 44.5 must render four access-controlled dashboards from the registry rather than recreate product state:

1. **Admission and realtime:** OL-CON-01–09, current ready replicas, protocol/version rejects, active connections/subscriptions, queue depth, reconnects and slow-client closures.
2. **Durable collaboration:** OL-DAT-01–08 and OL-PUS-01–07, projection/outbox/read/search/push age, retry, expiry, suppression and poison state.
3. **Execution and media:** OL-EXE-01–07, OL-MED-01–03, OL-HUD-01–05 and OL-MSH-01–06, with resource, cancellation, fairness and cleanup signals but no content or stable user/job labels.
4. **Migration and release:** OL-OPS-01–10, schema/checkpoint/shadow/version/rollback/backup state and every active kill switch.

The following are automatic stop/rollback signals rather than informational alerts:

- any cross-community authorization, routing, search, media, push, workflow, huddle or mesh result;
- accepted replay/stale generation, duplicate canonical execution or unexplained shadow divergence;
- secret/content canary in logs, metrics, push payloads, discovery or protocol errors;
- ready service with unavailable canonical authority, incompatible schema/version or disabled security control;
- queue/claim/lease state beyond its page boundary without successful reconciliation;
- client telemetry HTTP while the authoritative setting is disabled; or
- inability to stop new admissions and preserve one canonical owner during rollback.

## Verification and change control

- Tasks 22.12 and 45.4 run connection, subscription, fan-out, paging, search and push gates against OL-CON, OL-DAT and OL-PUS.
- Tasks 34.8, 41.5 and 45.5 run workflow, agent and mesh resource/cancellation/fairness gates against OL-EXE and OL-MSH.
- Tasks 38.7, 39.8 and 45.2 run media, huddle, tenant, redaction and protocol negative gates against OL-MED, OL-HUD and the relevant hard ceilings.
- Tasks 44.3–44.5 prove configuration ranges, private metrics networking, readiness dependencies, alerts and dashboards. A chart default is not approved merely because Buzz used it.
- Tasks 45.3, 46.1–46.6 and 48.4 prove migration, rollback, shadow and recovery limits before source retirement.
- Task 48.4 may declare final operational sign-off only when every row has enforcement evidence and its metric/alert appears in the operational artifact or is explicitly verified as a compile-time/client-only invariant.

Changing a limit requires the canonical owner, threat-model impact, compatibility effect, metric and alert to change in the same review. Relaxing a hard bound or removing a stop signal requires explicit security approval; measured tuning inside an already approved configurable range does not.
