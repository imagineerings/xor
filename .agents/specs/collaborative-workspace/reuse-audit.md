# Reuse Audit: Collaborative Workspace

## Disposition policy

`Reuse` means the named Zed owner already satisfies the audited semantics. `Extend` keeps that owner and adds missing behavior. `Port` moves unique Buzz behavior into a Zed-owned component. `Adapt` preserves an external wire or process contract while translating to the canonical model. `Merge` consolidates two valuable implementations. `Compatibility` is a deliberate long-term wire boundary, not a second source of truth. `Retire` removes a superseded implementation after gates pass.

No row is “not applicable.” The complete Buzz product is in scope. Unsupported or unfinished Buzz behavior is represented as a completion task rather than silently removed.

## Compile-time feature classification

| Surface | Classification | Evidence and boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settings::WorkspacePresentation` serialization | Compatibility shim required when disabled | Always compiled so prior `collaborative` values can be preserved without loading multiplayer crates |
| Editor workspace, `project`, `worktree`, `git`, ACP/thread/session, base credentials and existing collaboration | Shared and always compiled | Canonical owners are reused by both presentations; gating them would violate CAP-020/021/036/037 ownership decisions |
| `workspace/src/collaborative_*`, sidebar collaborative rail, onboarding choice, `agent_ui` and `git_ui` collaborative adapters, `zed` registration | Multiplayer-only and feature-gated | Native GPUI composition; absent from Standard Zed registration and compile graph |
| `collaboration_domain`, `nostr_compat`, Nostr signing/import extensions and future Buzz adapters | Multiplayer-only and feature-gated | Optional at first shared consumers; shared crates expose no default feature that can unify them into Standard Zed |
| `collab` Buzz-derived relay routes, migrations, jobs, compatibility assets and deployment profiles | Deployment-only capability controlled by the same release capability | Built/deployed only by explicit multiplayer release profiles; base collab behavior is not reclassified or duplicated |
| Capability/version identifiers and closed unsupported-operation error | Compatibility shim required when disabled | No tenant/resource IDs or multiplayer dependencies; rejection happens before lookup |

This classification does not alter any CAP-001 through CAP-045 canonical owner or disposition. Every future leaf that introduces a Buzz-derived dependency, module, migration, asset, action or service registration must attach it to D13 and validate both feature configurations.

### Planned-leaf feature classification ledger

The classification is semantic and applies to each artifact written by a leaf, not to the leaf's directory or the name of its containing crate. The abbreviations below mean **S**: shared and always compiled, **M**: Multiplayer-only and feature-gated, **C**: compatibility shim required when disabled, and **D**: deployment or operational capability controlled by the same release capability. In a mixed row, the boundary text is normative: shared owners remain **S**, while only the Collaborative Workspace extension, adapter, registration, migration, asset or service is **M** or **D**. Every existing and planned leaf under the named epic inherits this rule.

| Epic | Class | Semantic boundary for every descendant leaf |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | D | Inventory, coverage ledgers and source fixtures are release evidence; they do not enter either application binary. |
| 2 | D | ADR and ownership artifacts govern the multiplayer release capability without changing shared runtime owners. |
| 3 | D | Compatibility baselines and independent oracles are operational verification artifacts. |
| 4 | D | Threat, abuse and operations reviews gate multiplayer deployment readiness. |

A future leaf fails this audit if any write cannot be assigned by the row boundary, if one write changes both a shared owner and an independently reviewable multiplayer adapter without an explicit dependency split, or if a shared feature is gated solely because Collaborative Workspace consumes it. New exclusive dependencies and packaged payload names must also be added to `script/check-multiplayer-tools` or `script/multiplayer-build-profile` in the same leaf that introduces them.

## Canonical ownership summary

| Aggregate | Canonical owner after migration | Compatibility representation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local workspace, panes and presentation | `workspace`, `onboarding`, `sidebar` | None; Buzz desktop retired |
| Local projects/worktrees/files | `project`, `worktree`, `project_panel` | NIP-MP/NIP-34 projections reference canonical repository identities |
| Local working tree/index/diffs | `git`, `project::git_store`, `git_ui`, `AgentDiffPane` | Signed patches/review/status events and Git smart HTTP |
| Native agent execution and transcript | `agent`, `acp_thread`, `agent_ui`, agent/tool permission stores | ACP and NIP-AO/job/message adapters |
| Community/channel/message/workflow/audit records | Zed collaboration domain/service, sourced from signed events where externally authored | Nostr WebSocket/HTTP and Zed RPC adapters |
| Human service account and billing identity | `client::UserStore`/Zed service auth | Explicit binding to one or more collaboration npubs |
| Collaboration signing keys | Zed credentials providers | Nostr nsec import/export/pairing formats |
| Presence | Zed collaboration presence projection with source and expiry | Nostr presence/typing and existing room presence inputs |

## Accepted architecture decisions

The product owner accepted the recommended ADR-001 through ADR-006 outcomes on 2026-08-14:

1. **ADR-001 — service/database consolidation:** the existing Zed `collab` deployment is the final service and migration owner. A Buzz-derived Nostr sidecar is temporary, non-authoritative and removal-gated. See `decisions/adr-001-service-topology.md`.
2. **ADR-002 — identity binding:** a Zed account may use multiple community-local npubs, with one active signer per community/account/profile tuple, verified possession and history-preserving lifecycle rules. See `decisions/adr-002-identity-binding.md`.
3. **ADR-003 — Git hosting authority:** local working state remains native Zed state; each repository selects Zed NIP-34 hosting, one external provider or no hosted authority. See `decisions/adr-003-git-authority.md`.
4. **ADR-004 — huddle transport:** LiveKit is the sole native media transport, and Buzz Opus v1/v2 remains a bounded compatibility gateway into canonical rooms. See `decisions/adr-004-huddle-transport.md`.
5. **ADR-005 — push platforms:** APNs production plus sandbox validation and Apple App Attest form the first mobile-cutover floor. FCM and UnifiedPush require future approved profiles. See `decisions/adr-005-push-scope.md`.
6. **ADR-006 — shared compute policy:** shared compute is default-off, initially self-hosted, explicitly consented, resource/fairness bounded and prohibited from silent provider fallback. See `decisions/adr-006-shared-compute.md`.

These approvals unblock their dependency leaves but do not authorize production activation, irreversible migration, dual-write cutover or source retirement. Those actions retain the separate gates in `migration-plan.md` and `tasks.md`.
